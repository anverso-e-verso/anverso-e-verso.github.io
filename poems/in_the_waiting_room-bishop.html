    <div class="poem">
		<p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, <br />
I went with Aunt Consuelo <br />
to keep her dentist’s appointment <br />
and sat and waited for her <br />
in the dentist’s waiting room. <br />
It was winter. It got dark <br />
early. The waiting room <br />
was full of grown-up people, <br />
arctics and overcoats, <br />
lamps and magazines. <br />
My aunt was inside <br />
what seemed like a long time <br />
and while I waited I read <br />
the <em>National Geographic</em> <br />
(I could read) and carefully <br />
studied the photographs: <br />
the inside of a volcano, <br />
black, and full of ashes; <br />
then it was spilling over <br />
in rivulets of fire. <br />
Osa and Martin Johnson <br />
dressed in riding breeches, <br />
laced boots, and pith helmets. <br />
A dead man slung on a pole <br />
–“Long Pig,” the caption said. <br />
Babies with pointed heads <br />
wound round and round with string; <br />
black, naked women with necks <br />
wound round and round with wire <br />
like the necks of light bulbs. <br />
Their breasts were horrifying. <br />
I read it right straight through. <br />
I was too shy to stop. <br />
And then I looked at the cover: <br />
the yellow margins, the date. <br />
Suddenly, from inside, <br />
came an <em>oh!</em> of pain <br />
–Aunt Consuelo’s voice– <br />
not very loud or long. <br />
I wasn’t at all surprised; <br />
even then I knew she was <br />
a foolish, timid woman. <br />
I might have been embarrassed, <br />
but wasn’t. What took me <br />
completely by surprise <br />
was that it was <em>me</em>: <br />
my voice, in my mouth. <br />
Without thinking at all <br />
I was my foolish aunt, <br />
I–we–were falling, falling, <br />
our eyes glued to the cover <br />
of the <em>National Geographic</em>, <br />
February, 1918.</p>

<p>I said to myself: three days <br />
and you’ll be seven years old. <br />
I was saying it to stop <br />
the sensation of falling off <br />
the round, turning world. <br />
into cold, blue-black space. <br />
But I felt: you are an <em>I</em>, <br />
you are an <em>Elizabeth</em>, <br />
you are one of <em>them</em>. <br />
<em>Why</em> should you be one, too? <br />
I scarcely dared to look <br />
to see what it was I was. <br />
I gave a sidelong glance <br />
–I couldn’t look any higher– <br />
at shadowy gray knees, <br />
trousers and skirts and boots <br />
and different pairs of hands <br />
lying under the lamps. <br />
I knew that nothing stranger <br />
had ever happened, that nothing <br />
stranger could ever happen.</p>

<p>Why should I be my aunt, <br />
or me, or anyone? <br />
What similarities– <br />
boots, hands, the family voice <br />
I felt in my throat, or even <br />
the <em>National Geographic</em> <br />
and those awful hanging breasts– <br />
held us all together <br />
or made us all just one? <br />
How–I didn’t know any <br />
word for it–how “unlikely”. . . <br />
How had I come to be here, <br />
like them, and overhear <br />
a cry of pain that could have <br />
got loud and worse but hadn’t?</p>

<p>The waiting room was bright <br />
and too hot. It was sliding <br />
beneath a big black wave, <br />
another, and another.</p>

<p>Then I was back in it. <br />
The War was on. Outside, <br />
in Worcester, Massachusetts, <br />
were night and slush and cold, <br />
and it was still the fifth <br />
of February, 1918.</p>
