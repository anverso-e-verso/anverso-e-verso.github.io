		<p>1.</p>

<p>You die when your spirit dies. <br />
Otherwise, you live. <br />
You may not do a good job of it, but you go on — <br />
something you have no choice about.</p>

<p>When I tell this to my children <br />
they pay no attention. <br />
The old people, they think — <br />
this is what they always do: <br />
talk about things no one can see <br />
to cover up all the brain cells they’re losing. <br />
They wink at each other; <br />
listen to the old one, talking about the spirit <br />
because he can’t remember anymore the word for chair.</p>

<p>It is terrible to be alone. <br />
I don’t mean to live alone — <br />
to <em>be</em> alone, where no one hears you.</p>

<p>I remember the word for chair. <br />
I want to say — I’m just not interested anymore.</p>

<p>I wake up thinking <br />
<em>you have to prepare</em>. <br />
Soon the spirit will give up — <br />
all the chairs in the world won’t help you.</p>

<p>I know what they say when I’m out of the room. <br />
Should I be seeing someone, should I be taking <br />
one of the new drugs for depression. <br />
I can hear them, in whispers, planning how to divide the cost.</p>

<p>And I want to scream out <br />
<em>you’re all of you living in a dream</em>.</p>

<p>Bad enough, they think, to watch me fall apart. <br />
Bad enough without this lecturing they get these days <br />
as though I had any right to this new information.</p>

<p>Well, they have the same right.</p>

<p>They’re living in a dream, and I’m preparing <br />
to be a ghost. I want to shout out</p>

<p><em>the mist has cleared</em> — <br />
It’s like some new life: <br />
you have no stake in the outcome; <br />
you know the outcome.</p>

<p>Think of it: sixty years sitting in chairs. And now the mortal spirit <br />
seeking so openly, so fearlessly —</p>

<p>To raise the veil. <br />
To see what you’re saying goodbye to.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>I didn’t go back for a long time. <br />
When I saw the field again, autumn was finished. <br />
Here, it finishes almost before it starts — <br />
the old people don’t even own summer clothing.</p>

<p>The field was covered with snow, immaculate. <br />
There wasn’t a sign of what happened here. <br />
You didn’t know whether the farmer <br />
had replanted or not. <br />
Maybe he gave up and moved away.</p>

<p>The police didn’t catch the girl. <br />
After awhile they said she moved to some other country, <br />
one where  they don’t have fields.</p>

<p>A disaster like this <br />
leaves no mark on the earth. <br />
And people like that — they think it gives them <br />
a fresh start.</p>

<p>I stood a long time, staring at nothing. <br />
After a bit, I noticed how dark it was, how cold.</p>

<p>A long time — I have no idea how long. <br />
Once the earth decides to have no memory <br />
time seems in a way meaningless.</p>

<p>But not to my children. They’re after me <br />
to make a will; they’re worried the government <br />
will take everything.</p>

<p>They should come with me sometime <br />
to look at this field under the cover of snow. <br />
The whole thing is written out there.</p>

<p>Nothing: I have nothing to give them.</p>

<p>That’s the first. <br />
The second is: I don’t want to be burned.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>On one side, the soul wanders. <br />
On the other, human beings living in fear. <br />
In between, the pit of disappearance.</p>

<p>Some young girls ask me <br />
if they’ll be safe near Averno — <br />
they’re cold, they want to go south a little while. <br />
And one says, like a joke, but not too far south —</p>

<p>I say, as safe as anywhere, <br />
which makes them happy. <br />
What it means is nothing is safe.</p>

<p>You get on a train, you disappear. <br />
You write your name on the window, you disappear.</p>

<p>There are places like this everywhere, <br />
places you enter as a young girl <br />
from which you never return.</p>

<p>Like the field, the one that burned. <br />
Afterward, the girl was gone. <br />
Maybe she didn’t exist, <br />
we have no proof either way.</p>

<p>All we know is: <br />
the field burned. <br />
But we <em>saw</em> that.</p>

<p>So we have to believe in the girl, <br />
in what she did. Otherwise <br />
it’s just forces we don’t understand <br />
ruling the earth.</p>

<p>The girls are happy, thinking of their vacation. <br />
Don’t take a train, I say.</p>

<p>They write their names in mist on a train window. <br />
I want to say, you’re good girls, <br />
trying to leave your names behind.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>We spent the whole day <br />
sailing the archipelago, <br />
the tiny islands that were <br />
part of the penisula</p>

<p>until they’d broken off <br />
into the fragments you see now <br />
floating in the northern sea water.</p>

<p>They seemed safe to me, <br />
I think because no one can live there.</p>

<p>Later we sat in the kitchen <br />
watching the evening start and then the snow. <br />
First one, then the other.</p>

<p>We grew silent, hypnotized by the snow <br />
as though a kind of tubulence <br />
that had been hidden before <br />
was becoming visible,</p>

<p>something within the night <br />
exposed now —</p>

<p>In our silence, we were asking <br />
those questions friends who trust each other <br />
ask out of great fatigue, <br />
each one hoping the other knows more</p>

<p>and when this isn’t so, hoping <br />
their shared impressions will amount to insight.</p>

<p><em>Is there any benefit in forcing upon oneself</em> <br />
<em>the realization that one must die?</em> <br />
<em>Is it possible to miss the opportunity of one’s life?</em></p>

<p>Questions like that.</p>

<p>The snow was heavy. The black night <br />
transformed into busy white air.</p>

<p>Something we hadn’t seen revealed. <br />
Only the meaning wasn’t revealed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>5.</p>

<p>After the first winter, the field began to grow again. <br />
But there were no more orderly furrows. <br />
The smell of the wheat persisted, a kind of random aroma <br />
intermixed with various weeds, for which <br />
no human use has been as yet devised.</p>

<p>It was puzzling —  no one knew <br />
where the farmer had gone. <br />
Some people thought he died. <br />
Someone said he had a daughter in New Zealand, <br />
that he went there to raise <br />
grandchildren instead of wheat.</p>

<p>Nature, it turns out, isn’t like us; <br />
it doesn’t have a warehouse of memory. <br />
The field doesn’t become afraid of matches, <br />
of young girls. It doesn’t remember <br />
furrows either. It gets killed off, it gets burned, <br />
and a year later it’s alive again <br />
as though nothing unusual has occured.</p>

<p>The farmer stares out the window. <br />
Maybe in New Zealand, maybe somewhere else. <br />
And he thinks: <em>my life is over</em>. <br />
His life expressed  itself in that field; <br />
he doesn’t believe anymore in making anything <br />
out of earth. The earth, he thinks, <br />
has overpowered me.</p>

<p>He remembers the day the field burned, <br />
not, he thinks, by accident. <br />
Something deep within him said: <em>I can live with this,</em> <br />
<em>I can fight it after awhile</em>.</p>

<p>The terrible moment was the spring after his work was erased, <br />
when he understood that the earth <br />
didn’t know how to mourn, that it would change instead. <br />
And then go on existing without him.</p>
