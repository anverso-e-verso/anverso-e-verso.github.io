<p>Complacencies of the peignoir, and late <br />
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, <br />
And the green freedom of a cockatoo <br />
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate <br />
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. <br />
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark <br />
Encroachment of that old catastrophe, <br />
As a calm darkens among water-lights. <br />
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings <br />
Seem things in some procession of the dead, <br />
Winding across wide water, without sound. <br />
The day is like wide water, without sound, <br />
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet <br />
Over the seas, to silent Palestine, <br />
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.</p>

<h1 id="ii">II</h1>

<p>Why should she give her bounty to the dead? <br />
What is divinity if it can come <br />
Only in silent shadows and in dreams? <br />
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, <br />
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else <br />
In any balm or beauty of the earth, <br />
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? <br />
Divinity must live within herself: <br />
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; <br />
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued <br />
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty <br />
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; <br />
All pleasures and all pains, remembering <br />
The bough of summer and the winter branch. <br />
These are the measures destined for her soul.</p>

<h1 id="iii">III</h1>

<p>Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. <br />
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave <br />
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind. <br />
He moved among us, as a muttering king, <br />
Magnificent, would move among his hinds, <br />
Until our blood, commingling, virginal, <br />
With heaven, brought such requital to desire <br />
The very hinds discerned it, in a star. <br />
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be <br />
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth <br />
Seem all of paradise that we shall know? <br />
The sky will be much friendlier then than now, <br />
A part of labor and a part of pain, <br />
And next in glory to enduring love, <br />
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.</p>

<h1 id="iv">IV</h1>

<p>She says, “I am content when wakened birds, <br />
Before they fly, test the reality <br />
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings; <br />
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields <br />
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?” <br />
There is not any haunt of prophecy, <br />
Nor any old chimera of the grave, <br />
Neither the golden underground, nor isle <br />
Melodious, where spirits gat them home, <br />
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm <br />
Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured <br />
As April’s green endures; or will endure <br />
Like her remembrance of awakened birds, <br />
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped <br />
By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.</p>

<h1 id="v">V</h1>

<p>She says, “But in contentment I still feel <br />
The need of some imperishable bliss.” <br />
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, <br />
Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams <br />
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves <br />
Of sure obliteration on our paths, <br />
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths <br />
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love <br />
Whispered a little out of tenderness, <br />
She makes the willow shiver in the sun <br />
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze <br />
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. <br />
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears <br />
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste <br />
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.</p>

<h1 id="vi">VI</h1>

<p>Is there no change of death in paradise? <br />
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs <br />
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, <br />
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, <br />
With rivers like our own that seek for seas <br />
They never find, the same receding shores <br />
That never touch with inarticulate pang? <br />
Why set the pear upon those river-banks <br />
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? <br />
Alas, that they should wear our colors there, <br />
The silken weavings of our afternoons, <br />
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! <br />
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, <br />
Within whose burning bosom we devise <br />
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.</p>

<h1 id="vii">VII</h1>

<p>Supple and turbulent, a ring of men <br />
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn <br />
Their boisterous devotion to the sun, <br />
Not as a god, but as a god might be, <br />
Naked among them, like a savage source. <br />
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, <br />
Out of their blood, returning to the sky; <br />
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, <br />
The windy lake wherein their lord delights, <br />
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, <br />
That choir among themselves long afterward. <br />
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship <br />
Of men that perish and of summer morn. <br />
And whence they came and whither they shall go <br />
The dew upon their feet shall manifest.</p>

<h1 id="viii">VIII</h1>

<p>She hears, upon that water without sound, <br />
A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine <br />
Is not the porch of spirits lingering. <br />
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.” <br />
We live in an old chaos of the sun, <br />
Or old dependency of day and night, <br />
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, <br />
Of that wide water, inescapable. <br />
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail <br />
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; <br />
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; <br />
And, in the isolation of the sky, <br />
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make <br />
Ambiguous undulations as they sink, <br />
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.</p>
