		<p>On the fair green hills of Rio <br />
There grows a fearful stain: <br />
The poor who come to Rio <br />
And can’t go home again.</p>

<p>On the hills a million people, <br />
A million sparrows, nest, <br />
Like a confused migration <br />
That’s had to light and rest,</p>

<p>Building its nests, or houses, <br />
Out of nothing at all, or air. <br />
You’d think a breath would end them, <br />
They perch so lightly there.</p>

<p>But they cling and spread like lichen, <br />
And the people come and come. <br />
There’s one hill called the Chicken, <br />
And one called Catacomb;</p>

<p>There’s the hill of Kerosene, <br />
And the hill of the Skeleton, <br />
The hill of Astonishment, <br />
And the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>Micuçú was a burglar and killer, <br />
An enemy of society. <br />
He had escaped three times <br />
From the worst penitentiary.</p>

<p>They don’t know how many he murdered <br />
(Though they say he never raped), <br />
And he wounded two policemen <br />
This last time he escaped.</p>

<p>They said, “He’ll go to his auntie, <br />
Who raised him like a son. <br />
She has a little drink shop <br />
On the hill of Babylon”.</p>

<p>He did go straight to his auntie, <br />
And he drank a final beer. <br />
He told her, “The soldiers are coming, <br />
And I’ve got to disappear.</p>

<p>“Ninety years they gave me. <br />
Who wants to live that long? <br />
I’ll settle for ninety hours, <br />
On the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell anyone you saw me. <br />
I’ll run as long as I can. <br />
You were good to me, and I love you, <br />
But I’m a doomed man.”</p>

<p>Going out, he met a mulata <br />
Carrying water on her head. <br />
“If you say you saw me, daughter, <br />
You’re just as good as dead.”</p>

<p>There are caves up there, and hideouts, <br />
And an old fort, falling down. <br />
They used to watch for Frenchmen <br />
From the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>Below him was the ocean. <br />
It reached far up the sky, <br />
Flat as a wall, and on it <br />
Were freighters passing by,</p>

<p>Or climbing the wall, and climbing <br />
Till each looked like a fly, <br />
And then fell over and vanished; <br />
And he knew he was going to die.</p>

<p>He could hear the goats baa-baa-ing, <br />
He could hear the babies cry; <br />
Fluttering kites strained upward; <br />
And he knew he was going to die.</p>

<p>A buzzard flapped so near him <br />
He could see its naked neck. <br />
He waved his arms and shouted, <br />
“Not yet, my son, not yet!”</p>

<p>An Army helicopter <br />
Came nosing around and in. <br />
He could see two men inside it, <br />
But they never spotted him.</p>

<p>The soldiers were all over, <br />
On all sides of the hill, <br />
And right against the skyline <br />
A row of them, small and still.</p>

<p>Children peeked out of windows, <br />
And men in the drink shop swore, <br />
And spat a little cachaça <br />
At the light cracks in the floor.</p>

<p>But the soldiers were nervous, even <br />
With tommy guns in hand, <br />
And one of them, in a panic, <br />
Shot the officer in command.</p>

<p>He hit him in three places; <br />
The other shots went wild. <br />
The soldier had hysterics <br />
And sobbed like a little child.</p>

<p>The dying man said, “Finish <br />
The job we came here for”. <br />
He committed his soul to God <br />
And his sons to the Governor.</p>

<p>They ran and got a priest, <br />
And he died in hope of Heaven <br />
– A man from Pernambuco, <br />
The youngest of eleven.</p>

<p>They wanted to stop the search, <br />
But the Army said. “No, go on”, <br />
So the soldiers swarmed again <br />
Up the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>Rich people in apartments <br />
Watched through binoculars <br />
As long as the daylight lasted. <br />
And all night, under the stars,</p>

<p>Micuçú hid in the grasses <br />
Or sat in a little tree, <br />
Listening for sounds, and staring <br />
At the lighthouse out at sea.</p>

<p>And the lighthouse stared back at him, <br />
Till finally it was dawn. <br />
He was soaked with dew, and hungry, <br />
On the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>The yellow sun was ugly, <br />
Like a raw egg on a plate – <br />
Slick from the sea. He cursed it, <br />
For he knew it sealed his fate.</p>

<p>He saw the long white beaches <br />
And people going to swim, <br />
With towels and beach umbrellas, <br />
But the soldiers were after him.</p>

<p>Far, far below, the people <br />
Were little colored spots, <br />
And the heads of those in swimming <br />
Were floating coconuts.</p>

<p>He heard the peanut vendor <br />
Go peep-peep on his whistle, <br />
And the man that sells umbrellas <br />
Swinging his watchman’s rattle.</p>

<p>Women with market baskets <br />
Stood on the corners and talked, <br />
Then went on their way to market, <br />
Gazing up as they walked.</p>

<p>The rich with their binoculars <br />
Were back again, and many <br />
Were standing on the rooftops, <br />
Among TV antennae.</p>

<p>It was early, eight or eight-thirty. <br />
He saw a soldier climb, <br />
Looking right at him. He fired, <br />
And missed for the last time.</p>

<p>He could hear the soldier panting, <br />
Though he never got very near. <br />
Micuçú dashed for shelter. <br />
But he got it, behind the ear.</p>

<p>He heard the babies crying <br />
Far, far away in his head, <br />
And the mongrels barking and barking. <br />
Then Micuçú was dead.</p>

<p>He had a Taurus revolver, <br />
And just the clothes he had on, <br />
With two contos in the pockets, <br />
On the hill of Babylon.</p>

<p>The police and the populace <br />
Heaved a sigh of relief, <br />
But behind the counter his auntie <br />
Wiped her eyes in grief.</p>

<p>“We have always been respected. <br />
My shop is honest and clean. <br />
I loved him, but from a baby <br />
Micuçú was always mean.</p>

<p>“We have always been respected. <br />
His sister has a job. <br />
Both of us gave him money. <br />
Why did he have to rob?</p>

<p>“I raised him to be honest, <br />
Even here, in Babylon slum”. <br />
The customers had another, <br />
Looking serious and glum.</p>

<p>But one of them said to another, <br />
When he got outside the door, <br />
“He wasn’t much of a burglar, <br />
He got caught six times – or more”.</p>

<p>This morning the little soldiers <br />
Are on Babylon hill again; <br />
Their gun barrels and helmets <br />
Shine in a gentle rain</p>

<p>Micuçú is buried already. <br />
They’re after another two, <br />
But they say they aren’t dangerous <br />
As the poor Micuçú.</p>

<p>On the fair green hills of Rio <br />
There grows a fearful stain: <br />
The poor who come to Rio <br />
And can’t go home again.</p>

<p>There’s the hill of Kerosene, <br />
And the hill of the Skeleton, <br />
The hill of Astonishment, <br />
And the hill of Babylon.</p>
