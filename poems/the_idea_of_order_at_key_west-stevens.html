		<p>She sang beyond the genius of the sea. <br />
The water never formed to mind or voice,<br />
Like a body wholly body, fluttering <br />
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion    <br />
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,    <br />
That was not ours although we understood,    <br />
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.</p>

<p>The sea was not a mask. No more was she.    <br />
The song and water were not medleyed sound    <br />
Even if what she sang was what she heard,    <br />
Since what she sang was uttered word by word. <br />
It may be that in all her phrases stirred    <br />
The grinding water and the gasping wind;    <br />
But it was she and not the sea we heard.</p>

<p>For she was the maker of the song she sang.    <br />
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea <br />
Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.    <br />
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew    <br />
It was the spirit that we sought and knew    <br />
That we should ask this often as she sang.</p>

<p>If it was only the dark voice of the sea    <br />
That rose, or even colored by many waves;    <br />
If it was only the outer voice of sky <br />
And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,    <br />
However clear, it would have been deep air,    <br />
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound    <br />
Repeated in a summer without end <br />
And sound alone. But it was more than that,    <br />
More even than her voice, and ours, among <br />
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,    <br />
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped    <br />
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres    <br />
Of sky and sea.</p>

<p>             
             
It was her voice that made    <br />
The sky acutest at its vanishing.    <br />
She measured to the hour its solitude.    <br />
She was the single artificer of the world <br />
In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,    <br />
Whatever self it had, became the self <br />
That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,    <br />
As we beheld her striding there alone, <br />
Knew that there never was a world for her    <br />
Except the one she sang and, singing, made.</p>

<p>Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,    <br />
Why, when the singing ended and we turned    <br />
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,    <br />
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,    <br />
As the night descended, tilting in the air,    <br />
Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,    <br />
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,    <br />
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.</p>

<p>Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,    <br />
The maker’s rage to order words of the sea,    <br />
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,    <br />
And of ourselves and of our origins, <br />
In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.</p>
